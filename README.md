## Naming the Server
### Why Name the Server?
Naming a Windows Server, especially a Domain Controller, helps identify it within your network and avoids conflicts.

### Steps to Rename:
1. Open **Server Manager**.
2. Navigate to **Local Server** > **Computer Name** > **Change**.
3. Enter a new name (e.g., `DC01` or `AD-Primary`).
4. Restart the server to apply changes.
